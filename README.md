# What is Provincial Open Budget Visualization Portal?

As Nepal has moved to a new federal structure the provinces are a very important and integral part of governance, but they currently lack attention, also as we witnessed very less people are aware about the provincial budget. The budget is published but not easily accessible and understandable. How are the provinces allocating and spending the budget in terms of achieving the development targets? This project aims to inform people and the policy makers how the budgets have been allocated and spent in the provinces. Are the provinces doing enough to achieve the overall development goals, and what are their status? What area should be prioritized? This system will include a set of provincial budget data, which will be disseminated through the website. This will be considered as an important step towards transparency, corruption and avoiding waste of public resources, especially in the provinces of Nepal.

This tool is an interactive visualisation enabling you to drill-down into the major expenses and revenues for major offices and ministries of the provinces, for each financial year. This makes it easy to see where provincial funds are generated, as well as distributed and spent.

Where reported, the expenses are split into capital and current expenses, with expenses further divided into the expense types of employee; other operating; grants and subsidies; and other expenses.
